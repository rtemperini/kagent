/**
 * The filter bar, the URL state behind it, and what the three list pages claim about
 * where their narrowing happens.
 *
 * These are the properties the shared machinery exists for, and each of them replaces
 * something a page was previously doing worse:
 *
 * - **Selecting no namespaces means every namespace.** The old pattern was a separate
 *   "all namespaces" toggle beside a single-select — two controls answering one
 *   question, able to disagree. An empty multi-select has one state.
 * - **The choices are visible without opening the control.** A trigger reading
 *   "2 selected" hides which two, and "why can I not see the row I am looking for" is
 *   the question a filtered list most often provokes.
 * - **The view is in the address**, so it can be linked to and survives a reload.
 * - **The pages say where the narrowing happens.** All three of these RPCs return the
 *   whole list — `ListModelConfigs` and `ListToolServers` take an empty request, and
 *   `ListPromptTemplates` takes only a namespace — so a search in the browser searches
 *   every row. That is the fact the note on each page states, and it is what makes a
 *   client-side control honest here where it would not be on the substrate page's
 *   paged tables.
 *
 * Driving the antd multi-select needs one piece of local knowledge, which is why it
 * has a helper: rc-select renders a *second*, invisible `role="listbox"` for screen
 * readers, and `getByRole("option")` resolves to that one and then waits forever for a
 * visibility that never arrives — reporting the option as absent while it is on screen
 * the whole time. Locating `.ant-select-item-option` by its title is what actually
 * points at the row a person clicks.
